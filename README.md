Pudvox Demo
==========

This is a very early version of an OpenGL voxel engine. Currently it demonstrates
only rotating cubes which will in future be blocks that make up a game world.
The cubes are generated from points given to the rendering pipeline. In this version
there is no proper culling other than discarding cube surfaces that are not facing the camera.

The camera can be controlled with mouse and W,A,S,D,C and V keys.

When you build, make sure that the Assets folder is in the same folder with the .exe files.
