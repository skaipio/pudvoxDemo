Pudvox Demo
==========

This is a test engine using OpenGL with C#. Currently it demonstrates
only rotating cubes. The cubes are generated from points given to the rendering pipeline. In this version
there is no proper culling other than discarding cube surfaces that are not facing the camera.

The camera can be controlled with mouse and W,A,S,D,C and V keys.

After you've built the project, make sure that the Assets folder is in the same folder with the .exe files. There is also a [video](http://skaipio.kapsi.fi/videos/pudvox_demo.mp4) of the demo app.
